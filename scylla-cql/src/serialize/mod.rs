/// An error indicating that a failure happened during serialization.
///
/// The error is type-erased so that the crate users can define their own
/// serialization impls and their errors. As for the impls defined or generated
/// by the driver itself, the following errors can be returned:
///
/// - [`row::BuiltinSerializationError`] is returned when serialization of
///   one of types with an impl built into the driver fails. It is also returned
///   from impls generated by the `SerializeRow` macro.
/// - [`value::BuiltinSerializationError`] is analogous to the above but is
///   returned from [`SerializeValue::serialize`](value::SerializeValue::serialize)
///   instead both in the case of builtin impls and impls generated by the
///   `SerializeValue` macro. It won't be returned by the `Session` directly,
///   but it might be nested in the [`row::BuiltinSerializationError`].
